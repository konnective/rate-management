creating an ajax call api func
creating different models for separate tables
making controller for making an api calls
separating functions for each table type currently it will be 3
using switch case for calling fun based on keyword 


for now creating lets fix the form first

- now firstly changin the name for longitudes and longitudes after that applying fields and updattion funtion
now self explaining the updation process after pushing the already written code
lets self explain the process lets check it from profile
it has remained to change the 
- now applying the code first after that now first checking the profile is working or not
added col
